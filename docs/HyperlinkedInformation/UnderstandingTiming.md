Some notes on the "Timing" tab in `re-frame-trace`.

## Be Sceptical Of The Numbers

Two reasons:

1.  Accurately timing something in the browser is
    a fool's errand. One moment it takes 1ms and the next it 
    takes 10ms, and youâ€™ll never know why. Noisy.

    So, don't ever draw conclusions from one set of timings.
    Click the "replay" button ([#115](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-trace/issues/155)) 
    a few times to ensure the numbers are stable.
    
2.  Don't freak out about any apparent slowness. Not initially, anyway.

    After all, you're running a dev build, right, not the 
    production build?  And I'm guessing you're also 
    running a dev build of React? And `re-frame-trace`  will itself also add 
    drag, what with all that creating and analysing of trace.
    
    So, run the production version of your app first, before 
    deciding you have a performance problem. Something what 
    takes 100ms in dev might take 10ms in prod.
    
    The Timing Tab is not really about absolute numbers so 
    much as the relative time taken to do the different 
    "parts" of an Epoch. Is most the time going in views, or 
    maybe one view in particular? Or in 
    one subscription, compared to the others?
    And, even then, keep in mind point 1 (above). 
    
## Know Your Epoch Timeline

The Timing Tab is easier to understand once you have internalised the 
following graphic which shows how, operationally, the six dominoes play out, 
over time, within the browser.

## Other Tips 

It might be useful to have [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)
installed because it can show you visually, what is rerednering. Neat idea. But, realise it 
can also add drag and noise to timing results, so disable it when trying to get more 
accurate timing figures.

Here is (React 16) advice on [debugging React performance with Chrome Devtools](https://building.calibreapp.com/debugging-react-performance-with-react-16-and-chrome-devtools-c90698a522ad) 

The [re-frame.core/debug](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/src/re_frame/std_interceptors.cljc) interceptor is relatively slow, and runs interleaved with your application's events being processed. re-frame-trace gives you the same information in the app-db panel, but saves the calculations until after your application has finished running, so you don't get the performance cost included in your timing.
